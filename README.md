# Python Data Cleaning Practice #1 – Student Performance Dataset

Hands-on pandas project for cleaning and validating the Student Performance dataset.
This exercise focuses on practical ETL-style data preparation:
- Inspecting structure and data types
- Handling duplicates and standardizing columns
- Validating numeric ranges
- Creating rule-based flags for “at-risk” students
- Exporting clean and augmented datasets

**Files**
- `student_performance_cleaned_augmented.csv` – final cleaned and engineered dataset
